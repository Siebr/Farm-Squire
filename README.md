# Farm Squire
Farm squire is a python script that models nutrient flow and yearly operations on farms. This first release was made with beef farms in mind but we strife to have any farm be able to be simulated.

## setup:
We recommend installing [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) in order to run this script. Anaconda contains the latest version of pyhton, and all python packages used by farm squire are contained in the base install of anaconda.

In order to download the files of this repository to your local device we recommend using [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

## running farm_squire:
Once anaconda is installed, and you cloned this repository to your device you can open the windows powershell from you anaconda navigator. 

Inside the powershell you can [navigate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/samples/managing-current-location?view=powershell-7.4) to the directory the repository is cloned. This is for example done with the command: `cd D:/some_folder/Farm_Squire`

Once in the right directory you can run the script by entering the command `python farm_squire input_file.xlsx` different excel documents can be used as input by changing the name of the input file. E.G. you can run the example file by typing the command `python farm_squire input_example.xlsx`. running the script will make excel file containing all relevant output data. The name format of th output file is `squire_results_date_time.xlsx`

## making your own input file:
You should use the profided `input_example.xlsx` file as a template for your own input file.

the input file contains four different sheets: estate, crops, animal, and biodigestor. Each of these sheets will contain data relevant to their name.

All sheets in the example file will have some common formatting that is used to help understand the program: 
- Each sheet will start with two columns being: `properties` and `unit of measurement`. Each property indicates a statistic that the programm will use, and the unit of measurement indicates the unit in which that statistic should be supplied. 
- All cells/columns highlighted in gold are 'hardcoded' in the script and should not be changed. You still are in liberty to repurpose them to a likewise purpose, as long as you don't change the name or unit. E.G.: if you import sheep manure instead of chicken manure, you can simply put you statistics for everything pertaining sheep manure into all fields pertaining chicken manure. That way in everything but name you'd have the import of sheep manure implemented.
- All cells/rows highlighted in green are 'softcoded' and can either be renamed, or extended with additional entries. More on that later. 
- Some cells will contain a red corner, when hovering over them you will reveal a note with additional information pertaining to that cell. 
- All other (white) cells can be freely edited to contain the statistics as the are present on your farm. If the program regards a statistic that is not present on your farm, you can most likely put the value to 0 without much hinderance.

### the estate sheet:
The estate sheet contains all properties the pretain to your estate and all other properties of a singular value.

#### on crop rotations:
Say you have a piece of farmland that for some years serves the purpose for cropping land, and for other years serves the purpose for animal pastures. Since the core loop of the script only accounts for one year of time, you'd have to seperate that piece of farmland into yearly averages of occupancy.

E.G.: If you have 100 Ha of farmland that would rotate between three years of cropping, and two years of animal pastures. Then for each year of operation you'd virtually have 60 Ha of cropping land, and 40 Ha of animal pastures. These statistics should be supplied to the estate sheet as such.

#### on animal ratios:
The way the script is implemented the animal ratios (newborn, female, and male) only act as a desired ratio. This means that the actual numbers will vary but try to be as close as the ratio as possible. E.G.: in the example scenario for each fertile male the amount of fertile females would vary between 10 and 30 with a medean of 24.

### the crops sheet:
In addition to the first two golden columns the estate sheet had the crops sheet now ...
